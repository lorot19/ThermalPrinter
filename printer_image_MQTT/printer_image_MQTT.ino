/*
 * NO LIBRARY image printing for standard ESC/POS printer also known as EPSON script.
 * This sketch is using just standard Arduino.h library and raw commands described
 * by ESC/POSÂ® Command Reference
 * https://reference.epson-biz.com/modules/ref_escpos/index.php?content_id=2
 * 
 * Some printers like SparkFun or AdaFruit thermal printers are using newer commands
 * which should not work on older ESP/POS printers. This is reason why libraries doesnt work
 * for all printers. This sketch is written for GSerial GP-5890XIII but it should be 
 * compatible with all ESC/POS printers as it is using only standart and some obsolete commands.

 * This functions are used for logo printing. Logos iare stored in header files
 * as byte array. Each pixel contain 8bit of data. All pixels are stored
 * from left to right and from up to down direction.
 * GS v 0 0 is ESC/POS command header for bitimage printing.
 * According to the datasheet xL xH (yL yH) are two bytes representing
 * number of pixels in axis. It means that for example 
 * 
 * 160px is represented as
 *           xH       xL
 * BIN  0000 0000 1010 0000
 * DEC  0         160
 * HEX  0         A0
 *          but   
 * 240px is represented as
 *          xH       xL
 * BIN 0000 0001 0001 1000
 * DEC 1         18
 * HEX 1         24
 * 
 * However there might be some bug or missunderstanding because of very 
 * chaotic datasheet. The X value must be divided by 8 otherwise picture 
 * will be missmatched. But Y axis stay untouched.
 * Example:
 * 160px x 210px will be represented as 160/8 and 210
 * Serial.write(160/8); // xL
 * Serial.write(byte(0)); // xH
 * Serial.write(210); // yL
 * Serial.write(byte(0)); // yH
 * 
 * After that we are sending all bytes of image from array. There are no ending command
 * however in case of reset during printing, which is very frequent in high density images
 * it is recommended to use 1ms delay after each byte to get enought time for RX/TX.
